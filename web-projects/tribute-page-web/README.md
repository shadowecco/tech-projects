In response to the challenge:

[Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

I chose Chadwick Boseman because at the time, I was thinking of ideas to make a tribute page to and Boseman at the time seemed like the apporpriate choice. 

Created with:

- HTML
- CSS

(Bootstrap was added later to add a "View Button" as well as tweak a few other features. The main coding styles are stated above)
