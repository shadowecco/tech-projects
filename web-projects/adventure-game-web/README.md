I wanted to create a web version of my Python Adventure game. 

Template is influenced by [Web Dev Simplified's Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA). (Code can be found [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/JavaScript-Text-Adventure).

This is an on-off project so it will not be a regular process. Just something to test out any features of Python as I 
discover them.

Created  Visual Studio Code with:

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Jquery
