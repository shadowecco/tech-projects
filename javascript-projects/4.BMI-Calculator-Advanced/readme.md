## BMI Calculator Challenge (Advanced)

Create a BMI calculator using Javascript functions

BMI = weight(kg) / height2 (m2)

Calculate BMI as an output. SHould be rounded to nearest number.

Code should only contain the function. The result has to returned by the function

Now write a function that outputs/returns a different message depending on the BMI.

BMI < 18.5 the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi> so you are underweight."

BMI 18.5-24.9 the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi> so you have a normal weight."

BMI > 24.9 the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi> so you are overweight."
