#Challenge from the App Brewery:

Create function that tells us how many days weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old

It will take the current age as input and console.logs a message with out time left in this format:

"You have x days y weeks and z months left."

It must be assumed, there are 

* 365 days in a year
* 52 weeks in a year
* 12 months in a year

The console.log output must match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

**Example**
lifeInWeeks(56)

**Example Output**
"You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left"
