# Star Wars Name Generator

[Python Version (@replit.com)](https://replit.com/@HelenYates/4-Star-Wars-Name-Generator).<br />

Back in the late 1990s/200s, there was a trend of coming up with your Star Wars name based on the following conditions:

- first 3 letters of your last name
- first 2 letters of your first name
- first 2 letters of your mother's maiden name
- first 3 letters of the town you were born in

I decided to see if this logic could be used translated into a workable Python program. As a bonus, the program also generates a Star Wars-based alliance for the player.
