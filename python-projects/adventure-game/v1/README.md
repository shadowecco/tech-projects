# Text-based Adventure Game

This was a small cute little project started by FreeCodeCamp but the original file focused on input as well as conditions. I am expanding it to include imported programs and functions. 

Original article can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/your-first-python-project/)

Video tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZqAVck-WeM)

Original Python file can be found [here]https://techwithtim.net/code/)      

This is intended to be an ongoing project adding new paths and choices for the player. I also intend to make it as fool-proof as possible. Usually in python programs, when someone types in something that is not a valid choice, it tends to quit the game. I intend to create a loop for invalid choices. 

This is an on-off project so it will not be a regular process. Just something to test out any features of Python as I discover them.

There are two versions of the game:

* One with comments stating all the different game paths and my reasoning for certain logic loops.
* One that is clean of comments.


I am also learning Javascript and I would like to make a Javascript version of this so it can be playable on the web.
