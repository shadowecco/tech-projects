# Text-based Adventure Game v2

This was a small cute little project started by FreeCodeCamp but the original file focused on input as well as 
conditions.

I am expanding it to include imported programs and functions. This is intended to be an ongoing project 
adding new paths and choices for the player. I also intend to make it as fool-proof as possible. Usually in python 
programs, when someone types in something that is not a valid choice, it tends to quit the game. I intend to create a 
loop for invalid choices. 

This is an on-off project so it will not be a regular process. Just something to test out any features of Python as I 
discover them.

This is a different version to my original take on the game because I want to make it more complex. Whilst the player 
will have the same options as they did in the first version, there may be variations depending on the rank that the 
player chose at the start of the game.

The main file to start the game is "adventure game v2.py".

The text files are full of female and male character names.
The other py files are functions essential for the game. They are placed in separate files to keep the main 
file focused on the game flow and in a seperate folder to keep the game as tidy as possible.
