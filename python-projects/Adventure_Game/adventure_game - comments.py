#This was a small cute little project started by FreeCodeCamp but the original file focused on input as well as conditions. I am constantly expanding it to include imported programs and functions.

#Added comments to this new path so it can be easy to see the progress paths so it'd be easier to go look on different paths

#Comments in Upper Case reflect to the path of the game. Others are personal notes.
